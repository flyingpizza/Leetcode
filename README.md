# My Leetcode-pyspark Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for accepted submissions on Leetcode. These solutions prioritize simplicity over optimal performance. This project focuses exclusively on non-premium problems. I will try to add premium problems in future.

## This Project Focus on

* **Learning:** See how others approach common coding challenges using pyspark.
* **Inspiration:** Get ideas to improve your own problem-solving skills. 
* **Collaboration:** Feel free to suggest improvements or alternate solutions.

## Want to Contribute? We'd love your help!

I welcome contributions! If you have improvements or different approaches, please follow these guidelines:

* Choose a question: Pick any question that hasn't been solved yet.
* Provide a solution in pyspark.
* Create a clear solution file: Name your file descriptively (e.g., "1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products.ipynb")
* Submit a pull request.
* Get it merged.

## Disclaimer

Solutions in this repository may not be the most optimal or efficient. The primary goal is to provide straightforward solutions to common coding problems using pyspark.

* **Technologies/Languages Used:** List the languages featured in your solutions.
* **License:** Specify license terms (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.) 

## Note
This readme was compeletely generated using AI as I am pretty bad at writing documentation :)
